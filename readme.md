MONOPOLY DEAL

Monopoly deal web implementation using node, express and socket.io. 
Front end in js / jquery with the game interface modelled in DOM.
Currently under development with the intent to complete before lockdown is lifted, or my return to work (so probably neither, then).

If you'd like to contribute to this project or collaborate please get in touch.

I am new to JS so please don't mistake any of this for good code.
